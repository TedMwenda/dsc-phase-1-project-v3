**AIRCRAFT RISK ANALYSIS FOR ENTRY INTO AVIATION SECTOR.** 

**PROJECT OVERVIEW** 

This project evaluates aircraft risk profiles to support a company’s strategic entry into the aviation sector.
The analysis focuses on identifying aircraft types with lower operational and safety risks to inform acquisition decisions for commercial and private use.

**BUSINESS OBJECTIVE AND DATA**

The goal of this project is to translate historical aviation accident and safety data from National Transportation Safety Board that contains aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters into actionable insights that can guide leadership in selecting aircraft with reduced risk exposure during the initial phase of market entry.

**KEY OUTPUTS** 

A non-technical presentation present in the repository named as Presentation.pdf containing the business objectives, analysis, findings and recommendations

An interactive dashboard created from the data to support the recommendations:

A jupyter notebook in the reposirtory named student.ipynb with a deep dive into the analysis and findings.

**KEY FINDINGS** 

Certain aircraft configurations consistently demonstrate lower risk exposure.

Operational context (commercial vs private) materially impacts safety outcomes.

Simpler, well-established aircraft platforms reduce early-stage operational risk.

**TOOLS USED**

Python, with a focus on pandas for data cleaning and analysis.

Tableau for data visualization and dashboarding. 

Github for version control and documentation.
